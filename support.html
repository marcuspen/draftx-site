                    <h3>How do I create a league?</h3>
                    <p>To create a league, tap the "Create League" button on the home screen. Choose your league settings including draft order, squad size, and scoring rules. Once created, you'll receive a unique invite code to share with friends.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I join a league with an invite code?</h3>
                    <p>Tap "Join League" on the home screen and enter the invite code provided by your league commissioner. You'll be added to the league and can participate in the draft when it begins.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does scoring work?</h3>
                    <p>DraftX uses position-specific scoring where players earn points based on actions relevant to their position. For example, goalkeepers earn points for saves and clean sheets, while forwards earn points for goals and shots on target. See the full scoring table below for details.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I make transfers?</h3>
                    <p>You can propose trades with other managers in your league. Go to the Transfers section, select players to trade, and send the proposal. Both managers must accept for the trade to go through. Some leagues may have trade deadlines or restrictions set by the commissioner.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What happens if a player doesn't play?</h3>
                    <p>If a player in your starting lineup doesn't play in a gameweek, they will score 0 points. It's important to check team news and manage your squad before deadlines. Some leagues allow substitutions based on the league settings.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does the draft order work?</h3>
                    <p>DraftX uses a snake serpentine draft order. The order reverses each round (1-10 in round 1, then 10-1 in round 2). This ensures fairness across all positions, as teams picking later in the first round get earlier picks in subsequent rounds.</p>
