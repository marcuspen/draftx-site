DraftX brings the excitement of fantasy football to a simple, casual 5-a-side format - but with a twist that makes every position count.

Why DraftX is Different:

Unlike traditional fantasy games where only goals and assists matter, DraftX currently tracks over 25 different stats to reward players for excelling in their actual positions:

• Goalkeepers earn big points for penalty saves, high claims, punches and saves
• Defenders score for clean sheets, tackles won, blocks, and interceptions
• Midfielders get rewarded for key passes, successful dribbles, and controlling the game
• Forwards earn points not just for goals but for shots on target, fouls drawn, and creating chances

Key Features:

• Real-time point tracking during live matches
• Comprehensive scoring that reflects actual match performance
• Position-specific scoring - defenders aren't penalized for not scoring goals
• Clean, simple interface perfect for casual play
• Create private leagues with custom rules
• Trade players with league mates

Perfect for:
• Casual fans who want a simpler fantasy experience
• Serious players who appreciate tactical depth
• Groups of friends looking for fair, balanced competition

No more losing because your defenders didn't score goals. In DraftX, a solid defensive performance is just as valuable as attacking flair.
